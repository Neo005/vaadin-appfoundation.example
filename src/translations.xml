				<seg>=Introduction to the Authentication module=
				Unlike the module name suggests, this module is not just about authentication. Additionally to authentication, 
				the authentication module provides your application user session management, password handling utility methods and
				features for handling user accounts.
				
				==Security==
				The authentication module has several inbuilt security features, such as
				
				 * User's passwords are always stored in hashed format
				 * Protection against brute force attacks by locking accounts after a number of failed login attempts
				 * Protection against brute force attacks by logging out the user if the current password is incorrect too many times 
				 in a row when change the user's password
				 
				 ==Dependencies==
				 This module depends on the [[#persistence|persistence module]].

				<seg>=Authenticating users=
				The authentication module provides a simple interface for authenticating users. Authenticating a user can be done
				with one simple method call. The authentication is simply done by calling the static 
				{{{AuthenticationUtil.authenticate()}}} method. The method takes as input two string parameters, a username and
				a password. If a user is found with the given username and password, then the user's {{{User}}} object is
				returned. If there no user exists with the given username **or** if the password is incorrect, then a 
				{{{InvalidCredentialsException}}} is thrown. 
				
				The {{{InvalidCredentialsException}}} will **not** tell you whether it was the username that was not found or
				if it was the password that was incorrect. This is by design, just to make sure that your application will
				not accidentally become vulnerable to account enumeration attacks.
				
				The {{{authenticate()}}} method can also throw an {{{AccountLockedException}}}. This exception is thrown if the
				user account has been locked. When an account is locked, the Authentication module forbids a user from logging
				in with that specific user, even if the provided credentials would be correct. An account can become locked
				if a user attempts to log in with a wrong password too many times in a row.
				
				Below is shown an example of how to implement a login screen which uses the {{{authenticate()}}} method for
				authenticating the user. The example locks the user account after three failed login attempts (incorrect passwords).
				The example is reseted when this view is reopened.

				<seg>=Configuring the authentication module=
				==Prerequisites==
				The authentication module depends on the [[#persistence|persistence module]] so make sure you have it
				configured as well. Also, make sure you have the org.vaadin.appfoundation.authentication.data.User class defined
				in your persistence.xml file according to the persistence module's descriptions.
				
				==Setting up the authentication module==
				It is really easy to get started with the authentication module. The only thing that needs to be done, is to
				initialize [[sessionhandler|SessionHandler]] class. It is encouraged that the initialization of the 
				{{{SessionHandler}}} is done in the application's {{{init()}}} method. See the code example of the initialization
				process at the end of this page.
				
				The authentication module provides you with a variation of different configuration parameters which can be defined. 
				All configuration parameters are defined using java system properties. The following properties are available for
				the authentication module: 
				
				===Salt value for password hash===
				Before any passwords are stored in the database, they are encrypted with a one-way algorithm (a hash). The salt value
				is a random string which is concatenated with a user's password before the password is hashed. The resulting hash 
				value will be harder to break with brute force attacks compared to a hash without a salt value. 
				
				Note that once the salt value has been defined, it cannot be changed (- technically, it can be changed, but then it 
				would invalidate all existing passwords). It is recommended that you choose a salt value and stick to it. A good
				place to define the salt value is in your application's ContextListener (see example at the end of the page).
				
				The system property key for the password salt is authentication.password.salt 
				
				===Minimum length for a password===
				You can define a minimum length users' passwords. The authentication module will not allow the user to pick a password
				which is shorter than the defined minimum length.
				
				The system property key for the minimum password length is authentication.password.validation.length and the value
				should be given as an integer.
				
				===Password policies===
				The authentication module provides you with a set of predefined password policies which can be enabled or disabled.
				You can define that the password must contain
				
				* Lower case letters (a-z)
				* Upper case letters (A-Z)
				* Numbers (0-9)
				* Special characters (any character which is none of the above)
				
				The system property keys for the policies are as follows:
				
				* authentication.password.validation.lowerCaseRequired
				* authentication.password.validation.upperCaseRequired
				* authentication.password.validation.numericRequired
				* authentication.password.validation.specialCharacterRequired
				
				Each of the properties take a boolean as their value. True means that the policy is being applied on the passwords
				and any passwords which do not fulfill the requirements will not be accepted by the authentication module. The
				policy will be ignored if the property has a value of false.
				
				===Brute-force protection===
				AppFoundation has inbuilt protection against brute-force attacks. This is accomplished by locking an account after
				a number of failed login attempts. By default, five successive failed login attempts are required for the account
				to be locked. You can change the limit with the authentication.maxFailedLoginAttempts parameter. Note that the 
				parameter defines how many failed login attempts are allow, so if you set the value three, it means that the
				account will be locked after the *fourth* successive failed login attempt.

				<seg>=Getting the user instance for the logged in user=
				An application will occasionally need to know which user is currently logged in for the active application instance.
				Once your application has authenticated the user using the {{{AuthenticationUtil.authenticate()}}} method, the active 
				{{{User}}} object will be stored in the application instance. The {{{SessionHandler}}} class provides a simple and 
				static way to fetch the logged in user's {{{User}}} object. This is simply done by calling the {{{SessionHandler.get()}}}
				method. If the user is not logged in, then null will be returned.

				<seg>=Logging out a user and logout events=
				If your applications allows users to log in, then your application probably allows your users to log out as well. 
				Logging out a user means that the reference between a {{{User}}} object and an application instance is removed. Thus,
				the application no longer is aware of the previously inlogged user.
				
				You can log out a user anywhere in your application, simply by calling {{{SessionHandler.logout()}}}. This will
				remove the {{{User}}} object reference and dispatch a logout event to any possible listeners. The logout method itself
				will not affect your application's state in any way. Your application most likely will want to do some actions when
				the user logs out, for example, remove all views visible and show a login screen to the user. This problem can be
				solved by registering your application as a LogoutEventListener. Once an event has been dispatched, you will know
				that the user has logged out and you can perform any actions necessary. See code example below.

				<seg>=Changing the user's password=
				The authentication module provides with a simple method for changing a user's password - just call
				{{{UserUtil.changePassword()}}}. The method takes four input parameters: the first parameter is the
				{{{User}}} object of the user whose password we are about to change. The second parameter is the
				current password of the user, the third and fourth parameters is the new password and a verification
				for the new password.
				
				Using this utility method will provide you with the following features
				* Verification of old password
				* Verification of new password for typing errors
				* Validation that new password fulfills set requirements such as length, password policies (see 
				[[#auth-config|configuring the authentication module]] for more details)
				* Protection against brute-force attacks (user is automatically logged out if the current password
				is incorrect too many times in a row)
				
				This utility method is designed to be used by the currently inlogged user for him/her to change
				his/her password.  
				
				The example below shows an example of a "change password" form. The current password is "demo123".
			 	The current password's value is reseted back to this value each time you open up this view.

				Application Foundation never stores passwords in a clear text format in the database. All passwords are
				encrypted with a one-way algorithm (hashed) before they are stored. Before the password is hashed, a
				salt value is concatenated to the password in order to avoid rainbow attacks. The password utility class 
				provides a method for generating correctly hashed passwords. For example, if your user has forgotten his
				password and you need to create him a new one, you will need to create him a new password, hash the
				password and store it in the user object. Code example below shows this process and the usage of
				the password hashing method.

				normal Vaadin validator objects which you can attach to a password field.
				
				The example below show you how to apply the validators to a text field. The example has only a validator
				for a minimum password length. Note that the validator will get triggered after you remove focus from
				the TextField.

				has forgotten his password (note, rather generate random password than use this approach, this is only
				an example!). However, before the administrator can change a user's password, he must provide his own

				The {{{UserUtil}}} contains a method for creating new User objects. The method is called 
				{{{registerUser}}} and as the name suggests, it is designed to be used for user registration
				forms. 
				
				The method takes three input paramters, a username and a password with its respective 
				verification. Using this utility method will provide you with the following features
				* Verification of password for typing errors
				* Validation that new password fulfills set requirements such as length, password policies (see 
				[[#auth-config|configuring the authentication module]] for more details)
				* Verifies username's availability to avoid duplicates
				* Verifies that the username meets the set length requirements
				
				The example below simulates a registration form for new users. The form simulates a situation 
				where the username "demo" is reserved. Note that in this example application, the registered
				users are not actually stored, so the credentials cannot be used in other examples.

				Often applications need to be written for a multilingual audience. Therefore we must have a way to 
				easily make translations of our applications. Even though you know that your application will not need
				any translation, it is still a good practice to keep the natural language strings away from your 
				application code. The internationalization (i18n) module will help you accomplish that task.

				The i18n module builds on the TMX (Translation Memory eXchange) format, which has become more or less an 
				industry standard for storing translation messages. It is a clear and simple, human readable XML format. 
				If XML is a curse word to you, don't worry, this module will provide you with a tool for creating and 
				maintaining your translation file, just to ease your pain.

				<seg>=Translation files=
				The i18n module builds on the TMX (Translation Memory eXchange) format, which has become more or less an 
				industry standard for storing translation messages. All the translation messages in your application are
				located in one or more translation files. There are multiple conventions on deciding how you want to use
				you translation files. In some application, you may want to keep all translation in one single file. Maybe
				you want to keep all the translations for one specific language in one file and the translations for another
				language in another file. Or maybe you want to separate the translations based on application structure, so
				that the translations for one module of your application resides in one translation file and another 
				module's translations are in a separate file.
				
				The stub for a translation file looks like this
				{{{&lt;tmx version="1.4"&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/tmx&gt;
				}}}  
				
				Your translation messages are plain text messages in your translations file(s). Each translation message is 
				called a "translation unit" or "tu". Each unit has a unique identifier, called "tuid". The translation unit 
				consists of a number of translation unit variants ("tuv") where each tuv stands for the translation of a message 
				for a specific language. A simple translation unit in the translation file could look like this
				
				{{{&lt;tu tuid="GENERIC_USERNAME"&gt;
   &lt;tuv lang="en"&gt;
      &lt;seg&gt;Username&lt;/seg&gt;
   &lt;/tuv&gt;
   &lt;tuv lang="fi"&gt;
      &lt;seg&gt;Käyttäjätunnus&lt;/seg&gt;
   &lt;/tuv&gt;
   &lt;tuv lang="se"&gt;
      &lt;seg&gt;Användarnamn&lt;/seg&gt;
   &lt;/tuv&gt;
&lt;/tu&gt;}}} 

				In this translation unit, we've translated the generic string "username" into three different languages, English, Finnish 
				and Swedish. Often our messages need to be dynamic, in other words, we want to change some of the content of the 
				translation depending on some variable in the application. A common example could be a welcoming message which is 
				shown after a user is logged in.
				
				{{{&lt;tu tuid="WELCOME_MESSAGE"&gt;
   &lt;tuv lang="en"&gt;
      &lt;seg&gt;Welcome {0}, your last login was {1}&lt;/seg&gt;
   &lt;/tuv&gt;
   &lt;tuv lang="fi"&gt;
      &lt;seg&gt;Tervetuloa {0}, edellinen kirjautumisesi oli {1}&lt;/seg&gt;
   &lt;/tuv&gt;
   &lt;tuv lang="se"&gt;
      &lt;seg&gt;Välkommen {0}, din senaste inloggning var {1}&lt;/seg&gt;
   &lt;/tuv&gt;
&lt;/tu&gt;}}} 

				This generic message contains two parameters which are identified by the a number between curly brackets. These parameters 
				will be replaced with the actual values when the user fetches the translated message from the servlet.

				<seg>=Configuring the i18n module=
				You'll only need to do three things to get the module up and running. The first task is to register the servlet 
				in our web.xml -file. It can be done by adding the following rows to your web.xml -file: 
				
				{{{&lt;servlet&gt;
      &lt;servlet-name&gt;I18NServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
      &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.vaadin.appfoundation.i18n.InternationalizationServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
      &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;

&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
      &lt;servlet-name&gt;I18NServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
      &lt;url-pattern&gt;/I18NServlet/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;}}}

				The second task is to load your translations files' content to the InternationalizationServlet. This can be done by 
				calling the loadTranslations()  method in the servlet. The method takes as input a File object. A good practice 
				is to call this method in the application's context listener (see example below).

				Finally, you'll need to initialize the Lang class for your application instance.
